// DESCRIPTION:
// The Collatz conjecture (also known as 3n+1 conjecture) is a conjecture that applying the following algorithm to any number we will always eventually reach one:

// [This is writen in pseudocode]
// if(number is even) number = number / 2
// if(number is odd) number = 3*number + 1
// #Task

// Your task is to make a function hotpo that takes a positive n as input and returns the number of times you need to perform this algorithm to get n = 1.

// #Examples

// hotpo(1) returns 0
// (1 is already 1)

// hotpo(5) returns 5
// 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

// hotpo(6) returns 8
// 6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

// hotpo(23) returns 15
// 23 -> 70 -> 35 -> 106 -> 53 -> 160 -> 80 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

var hotpo = function(n){
  let  count = 0
  let x = n
    if(n === 0){return 0} //Optional Handler to n = 0
    else{
    while (x!==1){
      if(x%2===0){
        x = x/2
      }
      else{
        x = x*3 +1
      }
      count++
    }
  }
    return count
}
